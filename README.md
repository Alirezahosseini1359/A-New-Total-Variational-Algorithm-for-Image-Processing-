#	Two folders are added, denoising and upscaling. The first; "denoising" which contains Matlab codes for denoisng three test problems with four different total variation models; BARBARARUN.m for denoising test problem "barbara". lenaruuun.m for denoising "lena" test problem and rungold2 for denoising "goldhill" test image. The new proposed matlab function is main_newalgorithm2.m. The second; "upscaling" which contains Matlab codes for upscaling two test problems with four different total variation models; bikeupsrun.m for upscaling "bike" and fruitsrun.m for upscaling "fruits". The new proposed matlab function is main_new2_ups.m.
